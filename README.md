### Goal
Solve every single problem in LeetCode

### Approach
Progress from easy to mid, then to hard, and finally to contests, advancing only when I can consistently solve the next level.

Example:<br>
Solve easy questions until i can consistently solve mid ones. 

### Commit format
Number of questions if it's a good solution. <br>
Extra text "COME BACK" / "NOT GOOD" etc etc if I want to come back to it eventually.
